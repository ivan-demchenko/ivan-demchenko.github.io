We are human beings. Homo sapiens. We have became who we are because we have been learning. Playing the piano, running, solving math problems, chopping onions, writing articles, cleaning our apartments, programming, even making love, at the end. We can constantly improve by learning about our mistakes. Iterative approach is the key.

## When one hour becomes a week

One of the biggest problems in software development is estimation. When a new mate joins the team, how should he or she estimate a task? Where from existing team members should grab the knowledge in order to estimate their tasks? Imagine somebody asks you to add a button on the page that open a list of some entities. Sound simple, right? Or maybe not. In order to say how much time does this button costs (usually, businesses sell our time), we should think about:

* Did I understand the requirements properly?
* Can I split this task in smaller ones?
* Can I reuse something from existing codebase? Do I need to write something new?
* How easy is to solve the problem using existing codebase? Maybe I need to refactor something? If so, how expensive refactoring is?
* Testing

When the team conducts such estimations on a regular basis and then compares actual numbers and planned numbers, step by step they will grasp that feeling of complexity. But this can happen *only* if the team does these estimations *regularly* and keep the statistical records.

## Understanding

In order to give estimation we need to understand what we need to do. Very often it happens that team members don't get the whole idea of what they need to build. What I mean, is that, for example, designer has provided detailed mockups, the task has been split for you by the team lead.
