### Why componentizing UI

Everybody talk about components now. WebComponents have almost becase a standard, JS frameworks based on the ideas of componentisation. But is it something really new? I wouldn't say.

Let's think about a component in general. From my point of view, component is self-contained piece of software. What and how does it do is a different question. In other words, components are incapsulations or building blocks. Thus, we split and reuse parts of our system as building blocks.

For example, well-known Bootstrap. It is a set of reusable components that incapsulate some functionality. It might be just a button or something more sophisticated. But the important thing is that we don't care about this. For us, this is just a small of big Lego cube.

Every kind of system with a certain level of entropy tends to order. For example, recently I found such sample of code:

```
<div class="text-2em text-red m-l-05em float-right top-2em bottom-3em scrollable"></div>
```

This is almost one-to-one with the original. What can we say about the codebase written in this manner? I can only say one thing: it say a high level on entropy. In other words, there is no oder, no standard of which class where to use. It is exactly the same as a room of a teenager or purely organised company.
