Keeping documentation up to date is always hard. Especially for young projects, when the API is unstable.

I tried a couple of plugins for docs generation and my favourite so far is (https://github.com/darcyclarke/grunt-dss)[`grunt-dss`]. It has a nice template system and is quite flexible in term of adding functionality.
