However, I remember a not-so-distant past, perhaps, five years ago, when using CSS for simple UI elements was the desired approach. True, it has its limitations. But I don&amp;rsquo;t think we can discard CSS completely and rely on JavaScript driving even the most trivial elements of UI.
By applying (or at least trying to apply) the CSS-first approach, we can achieve some great results without necessarily relying on JavaScript.</description></item></channel></rss>
