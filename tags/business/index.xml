A person asked me: &amp;ldquo;Who cares? Users don&amp;rsquo;t care what language you use to build your product. Often the business doesn&amp;rsquo;t care either! There are plenty of companies with tons of spaghetti code, and they sell their products well! So why bother?&amp;rdquo;
Well, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t spontaneously say why I care.</description></item></channel></rss>
