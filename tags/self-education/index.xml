One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been reminded of is that interviews are tricky for me. As controversial as it sounds, it gets even trickier when I am asked questions related to my area of interest. It&amp;rsquo;s easy if you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about a subject - admit it, and that&amp;rsquo;s it. But when you&amp;rsquo;ve been working in the field for a few years and you know the question is related, but you can&amp;rsquo;t remember some of the details - that&amp;rsquo;s when it gets interesting.</description></item><item><title>Who cares about the underlying tech?

A person asked me: &amp;ldquo;Who cares? Users don&amp;rsquo;t care what language you use to build your product. Often the business doesn&amp;rsquo;t care either! There are plenty of companies with tons of spaghetti code, and they sell their products well! So why bother?&amp;rdquo;
Well, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t spontaneously say why I care.</description></item></channel></rss>
