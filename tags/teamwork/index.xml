I tried to draw some similarities between the software and construction industries. Both have architects, developers and engineers. So, how come, a software developer can become a software architect, while it is pretty hard to imagine a construction worker becoming an architect just by accruing experience and attending a few online courses?
This situation bothered me, especially after observing several software projects that had become hard to maintain and develop due to poor engineering or architectural decisions.</description></item></channel></rss>
