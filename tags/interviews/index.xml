One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve been reminded of is that interviews are tricky for me. As controversial as it sounds, it gets even trickier when I am asked questions related to my area of interest. It&amp;rsquo;s easy if you don&amp;rsquo;t know anything about a subject - admit it, and that&amp;rsquo;s it. But when you&amp;rsquo;ve been working in the field for a few years and you know the question is related, but you can&amp;rsquo;t remember some of the details - that&amp;rsquo;s when it gets interesting.</description></item><item><title>Why knowing the interview structure matters?</title><link>https://ivan-demchenko.github.io/blog/why-knowing-the-interview-structure-matters/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivan-demchenko.github.io/blog/why-knowing-the-interview-structure-matters/</guid><description>An interview is a bidirectional process, ideally. However, most of the time, companies spend as much time as they consider necessary questioning candidates while giving a few-minutes-long opportunity for a candidate to find out more about the company or the culture or a team the candidate might be working with. I believe this is unfair.
This approach may also introduce problems in the future after the candidate has become an employee.</description></item></channel></rss>
