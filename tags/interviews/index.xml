However, most of the time, companies spend as much time as they consider necessary questioning candidates while giving a few-minutes-long opportunity for a candidate to find out more about the company or the culture or a team the candidate might be working with. I believe this is unfair.
This approach may also introduce problems in the future after the candidate has become an employee.</description></item></channel></rss>
