Hi, I am Ivan. I was born in the South of Ukraine. I got my first computer when I was at 10th grade (children in Ukraine go to school for 12 years). That was a really nice PC: Celeron 700 Mhz, 128 MB RAM, 15 GB HDD, nVidia Vanta Video card and awesome 15" Sony monitor. I was a really cool guy with that set up. At that time, the most comfortable resolution was 1024x768 because monitor could keep 72 Hz refresh rate. I could set higher resolution but then refresh rate dropped dramatically.

After the first two weeks of non stop Quake III Area, I asked myself a questions "what is behind a web-page"? Thus, I started to goo... no, searching how to build a web-page. It was a great time! One discovery after another. Later, I decided that I need a good text editor. This is how I started with Delphi. Actually, I built quite a nice text editor with syntax highlight, tabs, live-preview and configurable set of functions (something like macros but simplier). However, I had to start my preparations for final exams and I stopped working on an editor.

Currently, my main tools are MacBook Pro and [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/). This blog is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
