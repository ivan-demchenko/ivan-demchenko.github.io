Recently, I started to work on a new project as a front-end developer.

So, as my first task I had to separate classes (PHP) from HTML and introduced the templating system to the project, that has been working since 1997 and has been rewritten multiple times (php3, 4, 5). That was quite shocking for me after beautiful code I saw before while working on previous project. After that, I took a look at JavaScript. And I realized that php-html-mess is not the biggest issue. I don't know what is inside author's head! Now it seems to me that is was done intentionally. You know, when people write a shift-code in order not to loose their job because only he/she can maintain it.

I am frustrated. Really.
