# About me

Hi, I'm Ivan. I love building web apps and working with great people! I am Ukrainian, but currently, I reside in Germany; I also spent a few fantastic years with my family in Australia.

You are very welcome to checkout my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ivandemchenko) and [GitHub](https://www.github.com/raqystyle) profiles.

### A bit of nostalgia

I got my first computer when I was at 10th grade (children in Ukraine go to school for 12 years). That was a really nice PC: Celeron 700 MHz, 128 MB RAM, 15 GB HDD, nVidia Vanta Video card and awesome 15” Sony monitor. I was a really cool guy with that set up. At that time, the most comfortable resolution was 1024x768 because monitor could keep 72 Hz refresh rate. I could set a higher resolution but then, the refresh rate would drop dramatically. Also, I think I still remember how to reinstall Windows 98 using floppy disk. Oh, good old days…

After the first two weeks of non stop Quake III Area, I finally got access to the Internet. Yes via modem and land line. The next question was "what is behind a web-page"? Thus, I started searching how to build a web-page. It was a great time! One discovery led to another. Later, I decided that I need a good text editor. This is how I started with Delphi. Actually, I built quite a nice text editor with syntax highlight, tabs, live-preview and configurable set of functions (something like macros, but simpler). However, I had to start my preparations for final exams and I stopped working on an editor.

### About this site

This is the 6th iteration. It all started with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), then I was playing around with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) + [Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Publii](https://getpublii.com/). Afterwards, I published my website with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

This time around, I decided to give [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) a go. I picked [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme as I it looks nice and clean. So far so good!
