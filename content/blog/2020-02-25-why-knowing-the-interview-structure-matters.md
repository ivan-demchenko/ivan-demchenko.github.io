An interview is a bidirectional process, ideally. However, most of the time, companies spend as much time as they consider necessary questioning candidates while giving a few-minutes-long opportunity for a candidate to find out more about the company or the culture or a team the candidate might be working with. I believe this is unfair.

This approach may also introduce problems in the future after the candidate has become an employee. Very often people become disappointed in the company they joined. Normally, it takes 4-6 months for people to realise how is everything organised. Then the motivation and the excitement of a new job deteriorate. I assume, we have all been there. It often happens that a company gets "sold" to a candidate as an "innovative and disruptive business", but in reality the only "innovation" there is an idea that top management sells to investors.

But had the candidate questioned the company (future colleagues or management) the same way the company questions that candidate, she/he might have had a chance to identify a "wrong" employer. This means, that, theoretically, a future employee will have a fair chance to make a more informed decision on whether to join the company on not.

It would be great to meet and get acquainted with the people upon whom your career might depend. Our jobs are not only our careers and titles and responsibilities. It is time we do not spend with our families, doing sports, self-improving, etc. It is time we never get back. So, I think as long as a candidate decides to sign a contract, it'd better be a place he/she won't regret.
