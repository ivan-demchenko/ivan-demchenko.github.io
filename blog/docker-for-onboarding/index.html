This is a great way to create a maintainable and easy-to-use development environment that can help streamline the onboarding process.\nBy minimizing onboarding documentation to a single command for starting a dev environment, you can save time and reduce the likelihood of software conflicts. Docker provides a consistent and reliable development environment, making the onboarding process smoother and more efficient for new hires.\nIn conclusion, technology can help simplify the onboarding process by minimising the reliance on outdated or incorrect documentation.
