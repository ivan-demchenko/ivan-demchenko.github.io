Mentour Pilot Boeing: Last Week Tonight with John Oliver Clearly, the Boeing’s business is selling airplanes, which, obviously, are the result of high-bar engineering practices applied to making airplanes. You would dissagree with me if I told you that putting engineering on the back burner is a good idea, wouldn’t you? Because, you know, you may fly one of those airplanes. Same goes for the cars, elevators, web-sites, apps, etc.\nThere was another video The Harsh Reality of Good Software by Awesome in which the author suggested why engineering practices in making software matter. Although, I agree with that person, I don’t think the arguments were compelling enough. That’s why I decided to write about these two pieces of puzzle.\nIf your business is about selling a product of enginering process, you want that product to be good. Sales people can sell anything. But there will be a backsplash from the customers, who paid money and expect things to work. All the poor choises and all the cut corners will remind of themselves and a slowdown of feature releases, bug fixes, and eventually staying ahead of competition. Remember the fable about the race between The Tortoise and The Hare? We can apply this idea to crafting products we want to sell. We may go fast, cut corners, promise we’ll fix it later, choose a quick language, skip writing tests - because, who cares? - whatever it takes to release the product and sell it. While the competitors may go a bit slower, pay more attention to good engineering practices and stay more flexible, in long run, they will stay faster. Their software is still soft, not tightened by the fixes and backstops that make every change scary.\nAnd by the way, as I write this, the internet is buzzing with a new kid on a bloc - Gleam. A langauge inspired by Elm, OCaml and Rust. If nobody cares, why new languages pop up? Clearly, somebody cares about getting past the initial release.\nGleam v1 had been released by ThePrimeTime Gleam 1.0 Is Out! by Theo Anyway, the story of Boeing was the last drop (or rather splash) for me. My experiences, the conversations, the interview and stories told by others resulted in this post as a conclusion. I strongly believe, that there’s a balance to watch for.
